    // Make sure a user can only like the same picture once. I feel like this should be easy, but we'll just need to know how the user is being tracked when they log in.

    // Ability to view the pictures you have liked? If we can do the above, we should be able to do this...

    // Popular page showing the top ten (or whatever) rated memes OR is this just what our home page should look like?
